## A Chrome extension to open a chess.com game in lichess.org's analysis. ##

 This extension has the following features:

* Uploads any finished game on chess.com, chess-db.com, chesstempo.com or chessgames.com for lichess analysis. 
* Works from the game archive as well as from finished live games.
* Automatically toggles the new 'computer analysis' check box on the lichess.org import page.

Thanks to Allan Rempel who created a similar plugin for chess.com v2.
